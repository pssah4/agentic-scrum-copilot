## ü•í Gherkin Scenarios (For New Functionality)

**Note:** Only include scenarios if this improvement adds new user-facing functionality. For pure refactorings or internal improvements, this section can document expected behavior preservation.

### Scenario 1: [Enhanced Functionality Happy Path]

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name - Enhanced Version]

Scenario: [New or improved scenario with specific conditions]
  Given [specific preconditions with concrete values]
  And [additional context]
  And [state that differs from original implementation]
  When [specific user action with concrete values]
  And [additional actions enabled by improvement]
  Then [specific expected outcome with concrete values]
  And [new capabilities enabled]
  And [improved performance/behavior]
  And [additional benefits]
```

### Scenario 2: [Backward Compatibility / Migration]

```gherkin
Scenario: [Ensuring existing functionality still works]
  Given [existing users with old data/configuration]
  And [specific preconditions from original implementation]
  When [user performs original action]
  Then [original functionality still works]
  And [new enhancements are available]
  And [data is migrated transparently]
  And [no disruption to user experience]
```

### Scenario 3: [Edge Case in Enhanced Version]

```gherkin
Scenario: [Handling edge cases in the improved implementation]
  Given [edge case conditions]
  And [specific unusual state]
  When [user action that triggers edge case]
  Then [system handles gracefully]
  And [appropriate feedback provided]
  And [system remains stable]
```
