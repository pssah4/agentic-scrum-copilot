## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Verify Fix (Reproduction Steps)

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]

Scenario: Bug is fixed - original reproduction steps now work correctly
  Given [preconditions from reproduction steps]
  And [specific state that caused the bug]
  When [perform step 1 from reproduction]
  And [perform step 2 from reproduction]
  And [perform step 3 from reproduction]
  Then [expected behavior occurs instead of bug]
  And [verify all expected outcomes]
  And [system state is correct]
  And [no error messages appear]
```

### Test Scenario 2: Regression Prevention

```gherkin
Scenario: Fix does not break related functionality
  Given [preconditions for related functionality]
  When [perform related operations]
  Then [related functionality still works correctly]
  And [no new bugs introduced]
  And [existing features unaffected]
```

### Test Scenario 3: Edge Cases

```gherkin
Scenario: Fix handles edge cases correctly
  Given [edge case conditions]
  When [perform actions that previously failed]
  Then [system handles edge cases gracefully]
  And [appropriate behavior in all edge cases]
  And [no unexpected errors]
```
