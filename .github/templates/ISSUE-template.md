## ü•í Gherkin Scenarios

### Scenario 1: [Happy Path - Successful Case]

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name from FEATURE-XXX]

Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name with specific conditions]
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  And the user has password "SecurePass123!"
  And the user is on the login page at "/login"
  And the user's account is active and verified
  When the user enters email "user@example.com" into the email field
  And the user enters password "SecurePass123!" into the password field
  And the user clicks the "Login" button
  Then the user is redirected to the dashboard at "/dashboard"
  And a welcome message "Welcome back, User!" is displayed in the header
  And a session token is created with 24-hour expiry
  And the user's last login timestamp is updated to current time
  And the user sees their personalized dashboard widgets
```

### Scenario 2: [Error/Edge Case - Failure Case]

```gherkin
Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name for error condition]
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  And the user has password "SecurePass123!"
  And the user is on the login page at "/login"
  And the user's account has been locked after 5 failed attempts
  When the user enters email "user@example.com" into the email field
  And the user enters password "SecurePass123!" into the password field
  And the user clicks the "Login" button
  Then the user remains on the login page at "/login"
  And an error message is displayed: "Account locked due to multiple failed login attempts"
  And the error message includes text "Please contact support or wait 30 minutes"
  And no session token is created
  And no redirect occurs
  And the login form is disabled for 30 minutes
  And an email is sent to "user@example.com" about the locked account
```

### Scenario 3: [Additional Edge Case - Optional but Recommended]

```gherkin
Scenario: [Another important edge case or variation]
  Given [specific preconditions with concrete values]
  And [additional context]
  When [specific user action with concrete values]
  And [additional actions if needed]
  Then [specific expected outcome with concrete values]
  And [additional expected results]
  And [state changes or side effects]
```
